Model
======
The `model` package contains the core building blocks of the application domain, including entities and value objects
that represent the business logic of the problem domain.

This layer is responsible for defining the rules and constraints that govern the behavior and interactions of the
application entities, and is independent of any specific implementation details such as databases or user interfaces.
By separating the domain logic from other layers of the application, the domain package promotes modularity, 
testability, and maintainability of the codebase.
