Use Cases
=======

The `usecase` package contains the implementation of the application use cases, which represent the specific goals
and tasks that the application is designed to accomplish. Each use case defines a specific business logic flow that 
is executed when a user interacts with the system, and interacts with the domain layer to access and modify the
application entities. 

By separating the use case logic from other layers of the application, the use case package promotes maintainability, 
testability, and flexibility of the codebase.
